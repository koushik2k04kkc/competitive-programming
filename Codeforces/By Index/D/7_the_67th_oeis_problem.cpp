/*
Construct a sequence a
 containing n
 integers such that gcd(ai,ai+1)
 †
 is distinct over all 1≤i≤n−1
. It is guaranteed that at least one sequence a
 exists.

∗
Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, the favourite website of math nerds, overly astute testers, and insufficiently rigorous coordinators.

†
gcd(x,y)
 refers to the greatest common divisor of integers x
 and y
.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤100
). The description of the test cases follows.

The following t
 lines contain one integer n
 (2≤n≤104
) — the desired length of the sequence.

It is guaranteed the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 104
.

Output
For each query, output your answer — a sequence a
 of n
 space-separated integers (1≤ai≤1018
).

Note
In the first test case, the sequence [1,6,2]
 is a possible answer. This is because gcd(1,6)
 is not equal to gcd(6,2)
.

In the second test case, the sequence [134,67,69,207,414]
 is a possible answer. This is because the values of gcd(ai,ai+1)
 for all i
 between 1
 and n−1
 are distinct. For reference, they are 67
, 1
, 69
 and 207
.
