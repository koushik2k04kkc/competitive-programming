/*
Winter holidays are coming up. They are going to last for n
 days.

During the holidays, Monocarp wants to try all of these activities exactly once with his friends:

go skiing;
watch a movie in a cinema;
play board games.
Monocarp knows that, on the i
-th day, exactly ai
 friends will join him for skiing, bi
 friends will join him for a movie and ci
 friends will join him for board games.

Monocarp also knows that he can't try more than one activity in a single day.

Thus, he asks you to help him choose three distinct days x,y,z
 in such a way that the total number of friends to join him for the activities (ax+by+cz
) is maximized.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n
 (3≤n≤105
) — the duration of the winter holidays in days.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤108
) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for skiing on the i
-th day.

The third line contains n
 integers b1,b2,…,bn
 (1≤bi≤108
) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for a movie on the i
-th day.

The fourth line contains n
 integers c1,c2,…,cn
 (1≤ci≤108
) — the number of friends that will join Monocarp for board games on the i
-th day.

The sum of n
 over all testcases doesn't exceed 105
.

Output
For each testcase, print a single integer — the maximum total number of friends that can join Monocarp for the activities on three distinct days.

Note
In the first testcase, Monocarp can choose day 2
 for skiing, day 1
 for a movie and day 3
 for board games. This way, a2=10
 friends will join him for skiing, b1=10
 friends will join him for a movie and c3=10
 friends will join him for board games. The total number of friends is 30
.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can choose day 1
 for skiing, day 4
 for a movie and day 2
 for board games. 30+20+25=75
 friends in total. Note that Monocarp can't choose day 1
 for all activities, because he can't try more than one activity in a single day.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can choose day 2
 for skiing, day 3
 for a movie and day 7
 for board games. 19+19+17=55
 friends in total.

In the fourth testcase, Monocarp can choose day 1
 for skiing, day 4
 for a movie and day 9
 for board games. 17+19+20=56
 friends in total.
