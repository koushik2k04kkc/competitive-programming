/*
James is learning numbers, and he is having fun writing them on a huge blackboard, from left to right.

At the beginning, James writes the number 1
.
Right after, James writes 1
 again, and then 2
.
Then James writes 1
, 2
, 3
.
…
In the end, James writes 1
, 2
, 3
, …
, n
.
For example, for n=5
, the numbers written by James make the array b=[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5]
.

James has a list of favorite numbers a1,a2,…,am
, and he wants to calculate how many subarrays of the array b
 are equal to a1,a2,…,am
. ∗

James is already sure that a1,a2,…,am
 is a subarray of b
, so the answer is at least 1
.

∗
The subarrays of an array [v1,v2,…,vk]
 are generated as follows: for each l,r
 such that 1≤l≤r≤k
, the array [vl,vl+1,…,vr]
 is a subarray. So there are k(k+1)/2
 subarrays in total, and some of them may be equal.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤500
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and m
 (1≤n≤105
, 1≤m≤200
) — the maximum number written by James, and the length of the array a1,a2,…,am
.

The second line of each test case contains m
 integers a1,a2,…,am
 (1≤ai≤105
) — James' favorite numbers.

It is guaranteed that for the given input, the answer is always at least 1
.

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n
 and m
 over all test cases.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of subarrays of the array b
 which are equal to a1,a2,…,am
.

Note
In the first test case, the blackboard contains the numbers

b=[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4]

and James has only one favorite number: the number 1
. There are 4
 subarrays of b
 equal to [1]
 (highlighted in red):

[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4]
;
[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4]
;
[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4]
;
[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4]
.
In the second test case, the blackboard contains the numbers

b=[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5]

and James's list of favorite numbers is [1,2,3]
. There are 3
 subarrays of b
 equal to [1,2,3]
 (highlighted in red):

[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5]
;
[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5]
;
[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5]
.
In the third test case, the blackboard contains the numbers

b=[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,6]

and James's list of favorite numbers is [3,1,2,3,4,1]
. There is only 1
 subarray of b
 equal to [3,1,2,3,4,1]
 (highlighted in red):

[1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,6]
