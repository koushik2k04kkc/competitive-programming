/*
Shohag has an integer n
. Please help him find an increasing integer sequence 1≤a1<a2<…<an≤100
 such that aimodi≠ajmodj
 ∗
 is satisfied over all pairs 1≤i<j≤n
.

It can be shown that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.

∗
amodb
 denotes the remainder of a
 after division by b
. For example, 7mod3=1,8mod4=0
 and 69mod10=9
.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤50
) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n
 (2≤n≤50
).

Output
For each test case, print n
 integers — the integer sequence that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such sequences, output any.

Example
InputCopy
2
3
6
OutputCopy
2 7 8
2 3 32 35 69 95
Note
In the first test case, the sequence is increasing, values are from 1
 to 100
 and each pair of indices satisfies the condition mentioned in the statement:

For pair (1,2)
, a1mod1=2mod1=0
, and a2mod2=7mod2=1
. So they are different.
For pair (1,3)
, a1mod1=2mod1=0
, and a3mod3=8mod3=2
. So they are different.
For pair (2,3)
, a2mod2=7mod2=1
, and a3mod3=8mod3=2
. So they are different.
Note that you do not necessarily have to print the exact same sequence, you can print any other sequence as long as it satisfies the necessary conditions.
