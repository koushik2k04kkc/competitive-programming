/*
Monocarp is playing a computer game. In order to level up his character, he can complete quests. There are n
 quests in the game, numbered from 1
 to n
.

Monocarp can complete quests according to the following rules:

the 1
-st quest is always available for completion;
the i
-th quest is available for completion if all quests j<i
 have been completed at least once.
Note that Monocarp can complete the same quest multiple times.

For each completion, the character gets some amount of experience points:

for the first completion of the i
-th quest, he gets ai
 experience points;
for each subsequent completion of the i
-th quest, he gets bi
 experience points.
Monocarp is a very busy person, so he has free time to complete no more than k
 quests. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than k
 quests.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and k
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
; 1≤k≤2⋅105
) — the number of quests and the maximum number of quests Monocarp can complete, respectively.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤103
).

The third line contains n
 integers b1,b2,…,bn
 (1≤bi≤103
).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than k
 quests.

Note
In the first test case, one of the possible quest completion sequences is as follows: 1,1,2,3,2,4,4
; its total experience is equal to 4–+1+3–+1–+1+2–+1=13
 (the underlined numbers correspond to the instances when we complete a quest for the first time).

In the second test case, one of the possible quest completion sequences is as follows: 1,1
; its total experience is equal to 1–+3=4
.

In the third test case, one of the possible quest completion sequences is as follows: 1,2,2,2,3
; its total experience is equal to 3–+2–+3+3+4–=15
.
